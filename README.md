## What is the Flashcards app?

The Flashcards app is an application that allows you to practice your knowledge using digital flashcards on your computer. You can create new sets, play with them, edit existing sets, and delete sets.

1. Common setup. Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

- git clone https://github.com/Xenko10/flashcards-app.git
- cd flashcards-app

## Why did I create this project?

I created this project mainly to enhance my React skills. In addition to improving my React coding abilities, I also learned how to use libraries I hadn't used before, such as:

- react-hook-form,
- react-router-dom.

I've also got better understanding of how to use Typescript.

## Do I think I could have done better on this project?

Certainly. The website's design could be improved; creating visually appealing websites is not my strong suit, and I acknowledge that I need to work on it. Additionally, the database structure and the Express.js server could be better. I recognize the need to learn more about these topics to develop a more robust backend.

## Was making this project worth it?

Absolutely. It was 100% worth it. I had the opportunity to learn many new things, improve existing skills, and identify my strengths and weaknesses.
